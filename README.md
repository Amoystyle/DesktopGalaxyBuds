Implementation for native galaxy bud support on all desktops.

  

  

## Building

  

To make the solution for mac or windows run Build.bat;

  

  

The windows build requires the winrt be be installed - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/get-started

  

One of the easiest ways to install the windows run time is through nuget.

  

1. Tools -> NuGet Package Manag

  

2. Search "C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)"

  

3. Click install, and then procced to restart visual studio.

  

  

Although if you don't use visual studio you may link manually.

## Direction
![Galaxy Panel](https://i.imgur.com/9hQaMkk.jpg)
In the end the project is looking for a clean looking user interface that allows for rapid connection with the GalaxyPods upon receiving a "notification" that the device is ready for connection. Alongside rapid connection we need to display signal strength, and the charge of each of the ear pods.
